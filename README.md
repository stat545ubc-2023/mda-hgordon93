## Vancouver Street Trees 
### Exploratory Data Analysis  

Last updated: 5 October 2023

**Project description**  

This project is an exploratory data analysis project created in RStudio. 

It uses the dataset vancouver_trees from the *datateachr* package in R, and the *dplyr* and *ggplot2* packages from the *tidyverse* package to investigate a street tree dataset for the City of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. The dataset contains information about public trees planted in Vancouver between 1989 and 2019, including tree species and cultivar, height, diameter, location, date planted, etc.  

The open data portal for this dataset can be found [here.](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/information/?disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name&disjunctive.on_street&disjunctive.neighbourhood_name&location=6,50.02186,-122.91504)
